# About me
Hi! I'm Eduardo, a software developer who likes to keep things simple and is always willing to help. If you need anything from me, just ask! 

I believe that modern software has become overly complicated, so I focus on simplifying everything step by step. 

## Project Documentation 📚
I think that documentation is key and should always answer these questions to provide context:

### What is the Project? 🤔
Provide a brief description of the project, its purpose, and its goals.

### Why Does it Exist? ❓
Explain the problem the project aims to solve and why it is important.

### Tools Used and Why 🛠️
List the tools, libraries, and frameworks used in the project and explain why they were chosen.

### How to Install 💾
Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project.

### How to Use It 🚀
Explain how to use the project, including code examples and screenshots.

### How to Contribute 🤝
Describe how others can contribute to the project, including guidelines for submitting issues and pull requests.

I also believe that documentation should be dynamically generated from the code (e.g., REST APIs) and should live in the README. 📄
